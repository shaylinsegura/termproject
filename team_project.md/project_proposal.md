# Project Proposal 
#### By: Shaylin Segura, Kimberly Park, Minghui Li
 

## Big Idea: Twitter Bot for Meaningful Dialog 
>A bot that filters through twitter posts and comments to identify keywords connecting to people interested in the chemical free hair and skin product space. The bot will engage them in a meaningful dialog to build a positive relationship to create community.
 
### Minimum Viable Product 
To create a chat bot that identifies posts and comments and replies with appropriate responses. 
 
### Stretch Goal 
For the bot to identify appropriate user engagement and have a conversation that makes the user feel heard and supported or assisted. Additionally the bot would be implemented for a real business. 
 

## Learning Goals
1. To apply the fundamental coding knowledge we have been introduced to during class and expand on those concepts. We want to understand the concepts wholistically and feel confident coding and learning how to expand our knowldge base.  
 
2. To make the project a useful and versatile program that can be used not only in the beauty industry, but as a template across fields where creating meaningful dialogues with consumers and maintaining customer relationships is needed. 
 
3. To leave this class with a deep understanding of applying python in a practical way and understanding how it engages with other platforms and how code interacts with API’s. 
 
4. To learn from the process of programming with a group and to learn how to effectively peer-programm. 
 
5. Communicate intentions and expectations while organizing code and work for a project of this scale. 
 

## Implementation Plan 
>By applying the Chatterbot Library, we will be writing the Chatterbot function. In order for the function to read natural language data and apply it, we are planning on using NLP Tool Kit.
>Incorporate Twitter sentiment analysis packages (Tweetpy, textblob) to help reach the goal of the project. 
>Create Twitter API with Tweepy (i.e. tweepy.API) to filter tweet based keywords
>Identify the database of words we will be using or not using (including appropriate punctuation). 
>Classify the keywords into three categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral). We will need to create different lists of words to then initialize the training data.
>Run the Bot and test to verify that it returns appropriate response to different keyword classes 
 

## Project Schedule 
### Overview
We will engage in work sessions as a group 3 times weekly. Once each week we will convene to discuss progress and reflect on any difficulties that have arisen technically or as a team and discuss where we can improve in both areas. Small portions of the work that have been discussed and agreed upon will be divided out so individuals can make progress according to their respective time zones and work schedules before bringing back to the group for assistance and review. 
Questions that arise will first be communicated through a private slack channel with the three team members and then brought up to the wider community or the professor if they can still not be solved. Individual work will not be added to the main project without testing and review from the other two group members. All scheduling will be kept in Eastern Standard Time.

* Weekly team meetings: Tuesday & Thursday’s 9:30 est. 
* Work Sessions: Tuesday, Friday, Sat, Sundays

* Week 1 Sept 27 - Oct 3
  * Platforms, packages, and API foundations understood and planned

  * Strategy and Psuedo Code Outline Finished 
* Week 3 Oct 10 - Oct 17
  * Coding, testing, fixing
  * Meet with Proffessor to confirm we are moving in the right direction 
* Week 4 Oct 18 - Oct 24
  * Coding, testing, fixing
* Week 5 Oct 25 - Oct 31
  * Coding, testing, fixing

  * Meet with Proffessor to confirm we are moving in the right direction 
* Week 7 Nov 8 - Nov 14
  * Edits and Optimizations added
* Week 8: Nov 15 - Nov 19
  * Testing program and final edits made
* Thursday, November 19th: Final Demo / Presentation Session 
* Monday, November 30th: Code Submission 
 

## Collaboration Plan
Communication will take place on WhatsApp with the group and extend to slack for issues that are raised to the class and professor.  
The group will first align on the overall steps. Then section by section writing out and agreeing on the pseudo code to build out the framework. 
In pairs, work will be completed as a team and parts will also be assigned to individuals. 
Work will always be assigned to individuals so work can be completed outside of the paired and group work sessions. 
Coding sessions will occur multiple times weekly allowing members to to integrate the code together and solve potential problems during in person meetings.
Any ideas, concerns, and questions will be communicated through the WhatsApp chat group and acknowledged as still a problem or resolved during weekly meetings. 
 

## Predicting Risks 
* During sessions where we work independently, we might encounter misaligned visions and have trouble integrating code together. In order to work to prevent this risk, during weekly meetings, we need to ensure the vision logic is aligned among us and is clearly demonstrated throughout the programming.
 
* Time Difference is also another challenge as members are working in different time zones. Members need to keep transparent communication to ensure that everyone knows what needs to be worked on and we can be clear about scheduling peer programming sessions and discussing code before it is merged. This will be vital in allowing us to complete a quality project that meets our vision.
 
 
## Helpful Course Content Suggestions
 
* How will the program (in the team’s case, the chatbot) continue running infinitely on loop.
* How will the program be accessed? (an icon for the chatbot linked to a program within a website?).
* What is an API and how to apply it for the project.
